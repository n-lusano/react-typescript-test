### About

This small WIP project is my first serious attempt at TypeScript :v: and it's a very easy To Do List app, just to get started and practice what I learnt at the bootcamp.
I'm still learning the new syntax, so I will get a sense for a wireframe and better organized userstories soon :grin:

### Technologies

- React
- TypeScript
- Styling: _coming soon!_

### Project User Stories and Wireframe
_Coming soon!_ :sparkles:

### Available Scripts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Please refer to the [CRA_DOCS](https://github.com/n-lusano/react-typescript-test/blob/development/CRA_DOCS.md).
